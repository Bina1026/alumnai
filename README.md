## 🖥️ Mechanism

![Whole Workflow](./workflow.png)

To accomplish our final goal of making summary from recorded audio file of the class and lecture note, we need the following tasks to be done: high-quality STT, and PDF recognition system

### 1. High-quality STT
Our current approach is fine-tuning faster-whisper with medical terminology.  
Dataset is generated by [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/), by making Amazon Polly read English medical terminology in a Korean accent.  
We have found that this method helps improve the performance of our model on recorded classroom speech datasets.  
Other possible fine-tuning datasets include ER conversation datasets from [AI-hub](https://www.aihub.or.kr/), STT models from OpenAI, etc.  

There is also room for improvement in preprocessing and postprocessing.  
For preprocessing, we are experimenting with noise reduction.  
For postprocessing, we are working on error correction using LLMs, based on the fact that LLMs can read the entire context.

### 2. PDF recognition system
We then have to make summary based on STT result and PDF recognition system.
For that, we extract meaningful informations as text file from PDF file this by using multimodal AI, specifically Llama 3.1.
Then both STT result text and PDF extraction text is embedded as vector, using Amazon Titan v2.
Based on similarities of each vector, we find the most probable match between STT text and PDF slide using dynamic programming.
This alignment process can be improved either by using higher-quality STT or by implementing a more effective alignment algorithm.

After all this work, we can get the following summary!
