## 🔍 Mechanism

AlumnAI combines **state-of-the-art technologies** to achieve its goal. Here's how:

### 1️⃣ High-Quality STT 🌐
- Fine-tuned **Faster-Whisper** to understand **medical terminology**.  
- **Dataset Creation:**  
  - Leveraging **Amazon Polly** to generate synthetic speech of English medical terms spoken with a Korean accent.  
  - Exploring other datasets like AI-hub’s ER conversations and OpenAI's STT outputs.  

- **Preprocessing Improvements:**  
  - Noise reduction techniques for better clarity.  

- **Postprocessing Enhancements:**  
  - **Error correction** using **LLMs** that analyze the entire context.  

---

### 2️⃣ PDF Recognition System 📄
- Extracts text from slides using **Llama 3.1**, a multimodal AI.  
- Embeds both STT and PDF text as vectors using **Amazon Titan v2**.  
- Aligns STT results with slides via **dynamic programming**, ensuring the best match.  

### 🚀 End Result
Once aligned, AlumnAI generates a clean, summarized version of your lecture notes! 🎉
